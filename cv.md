# Stanislav Petrov

In 2004, I self-main learned PHP, JS and made many commercial websites. In 2010, I changed my field of activity, moving from IT to tourism. In 2022, I decided to return to website development. A lot has changed in this area, new technologies have appeared. Now I am expanding my knowledge of modern front-end and back-end, and have also become interested in developing games in Unity + C#.
